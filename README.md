Simple Mastermind game made with JavaFX :smiley:

# Instructions

Your goal is to figure out the sequence of colors that are hidden behind the "?" markers at the top.
Use either the mouse buttons or the scroll wheel to select a color sequence and click "check" when you think you are right.
The computer will give you feedback in the form of white and red dots. 
A white dot means that you have included a correct color, but that the color is in the incorrect position.
A red dot means that you have included a correct color AND that you got its position right.
None of the dots indicate which entry of the sequence it refers to.
